//You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
//
//Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
//
//n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

//Example 1:
//
//n = 5
//
//The coins can form the following rows:
//¤
//¤ ¤
//¤ ¤
//
//Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

//Example 2:
//
//n = 8
//
//The coins can form the following rows:
//¤
//¤ ¤
//¤ ¤ ¤
//¤ ¤
//
//Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
